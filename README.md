Result Management System


Project Overview

The Result Management System is a software application designed to efficiently manage student results and academic records. It leverages big data processing, machine learning, and real-time streaming technologies to handle large datasets and provide insightful analytics. The system allows administrators and teachers to input, update, analyze, and visualize student results with ease.

Usage

The system processes student marks and calculates statistical insights.

Kafka is used to stream real-time result data for analysis.

MongoDB stores student feedback and processed results.

Machine learning classifies feedback as positive or negative.

Results and insights are saved in HDFS and visualized using Matplotlib.
